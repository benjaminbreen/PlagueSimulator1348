## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub (without the `.env.local` file - it's gitignored)

2. Import your repository in [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

3. Add the environment variable in Vercel:
   - Go to Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Add: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` with your Gemini API key value
   - Make sure it's available for Production, Preview, and Development

4. Deploy! Vercel will automatically build and deploy your app

**Note**: The `VITE_` prefix is required for Vite to expose the variable to the client-side code.
